"""Wordle reward function for verl GRPO training.

This module provides ``compute_score``, compatible with verl's
``custom_reward_function`` interface. It is invoked per-rollout with the
generated solution_str and dataset fields.

Reward Components:
  - correct_answer (1.0): exact match with secret word
  - partial_answer (0.0-0.8): partial credit per green/yellow letter
  - length_bonus (0.0-1.0): bonus for shorter correct solutions
  - format_reward (0.0-1.0): fraction of turns using <guess>[word]</guess>

The final reward uses the same four-part shape as the Verifiers Wordle rubric.
Unlike the upstream environment, this recipe intentionally keeps the best
partial guess in the trajectory as a denser shaping signal.
